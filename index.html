        <p style="text-align: center;">The consequences on security with the rise of new technologies</p>

        <p>New technologies have been the center in the development of the world since the beginning of times. It allows
            people to perform daily tasks, benefit of advantages in all sectors, and enjoy various types of
            entertainment. However, this advantages also come with new risks, as these emerging technologies have come
            to attract the attention from criminals around the globe looking to exploit any kind of advantage, they can
            get over an organization, system, or technology to bring them any benefit or satisfaction. Organizations
            have recently taken a notice on this problem and are willing to pay large amounts of money to maintain their
            information secured from people potentially wanting to harm them. The most common problems consist in the
            appearance of new types of criminals, the way these criminals are judicialized, the emergent roles in
            companies to protect their information, the way people are approaching such technologies, among others.</p>
        <p> Cyber-attacks are rising at the alarming pace. These criminals make use of different exploits such as
            Malware, Man in the middle, DDOS, SQL injections, Password attacks etc. to take advantage if certain system
            and acquire, modify, or even restrict the use of certain data a system has. In 2013 Adobe announced the
            information of 150 million accounts were stolen along with 40 GB of source code from certain application.
            This happened as a vulnerability was found where the publisher of the application had set up a password
            without sufficient methods of security to protect it which caused the hackers to find a direct way inside
            the administrator permissions of the platform. As many different methods of accessing a new technology have
            become easier companies not only have to invest in personnel to maintain their systems, but also ethical
            hackers which help them discover their vulnerabilities and pathways to enter their system. </p>
        <p> The ethical hacking is a term used to describe the role in a company which not only helps to search the
            vulnerabilities, but also helps to test the upcoming software of various companies to test their security,
            capabilities, and limits. These people are often former hackers who use their previous experience to avoid
            these types of attacks within companies and maintain a more secure software. In 2018, Eric Holmes was able
            to gain access to Homebrew’s source code in git which allowed him to make changes and exposing their supply
            chain. If malicious he could have installed an unnoticed change which would have allowed him to perform a
            backdoor within every machine who installed the software. However, Holmes decided to immediately report the
            vulnerability to a developer within the company which rapidly fixed and patched the bug. Unlike ethical
            hacking, common hackers don’t have any good intentions with the use of advantages they get which is also why
            most of them don’t get judicialized, or when they do, they can’t be processed correctly as the complexity of
            the crimes can’t be analyzed by the judge or jury correctly. </p>
        <p> Within a normal trial in court judges can process a case by using the constitution as base to define whether
            a person is guilty or not, and the magnitude of their crime. However, as many of the crimes committed are
            within the technology field and not stated in the constitution properly nor specifically, judges don’t have
            the means to process the case correctly. Also, most of the time judges don’t even have enough knowledge of
            the crime which creates a barrier for the criminal to be properly judicialized. In 2020 Facebook was audited
            due to the sharing of information to data analysis company for massive commercial use. When presented,
            judges didn’t have enough knowledge to assess Facebook nor Mark Zuckerberg case correctly which led to
            various disinformation and off-topic questions further blocking the path to a correct procedure and
            assessment towards Facebook case. The lack of justice and fair trials for hackers have brought people to
            take actions upon themselves as mostly harmless and massively known as hacktivism. </p>
        <p> Hacktivism is a term commonly use to describe a person or a group of people which uses any kind of
            technological tool to perform an action towards a group, person, ideology or company which are doing
            something against their beliefs. These hacktivist groups are not looking to harm a company or group for
            malicious purposes but to prevent or stop a behavior an entity is having as a form of protest. In 1989 a
            virus was released upon the NASA, which was sending Galileo to Jupyter for the use of nuclear material in
            their construction. The worm infected the computers on the NASA network attempting to stop the launch of
            Galileo by threatening to erase every file on each infected computer as operators would wipe infected
            computers to protect the rest of the network, as in fact, the worm just showed the message without touching
            any file, making the loss of any information as the operators’ fault.</p>
        <p> Nowadays as technology keeps advancing, criminals get more opportunities and pathways to obtain benefits
            from companies or groups, but as these malicious intends appear, a large amount of counterparts also spawn
            to help counterfeit and reinforce vulnerable systems which in the end would try to accomplish the objectives
            already mentioned for modern society with technology such as perform daily tasks, benefit of advantages in
            all sectors, and enjoy various types of entertainment.</p>
