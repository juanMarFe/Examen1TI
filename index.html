    <header>The consequences on security with the rise of new technologies</header>
<p>
   New technologies have been the center in the development of the world since the beginning of times. It allows people to perform daily tasks, benefit of advantages in all sectors, and enjoy various types of entertainment. However, this advantages also come with new risks, as these emerging technologies have come to attract the attention from criminals around the globe looking to exploit any kind of advantage, they can get over an organization, system, or technology to bring them any benefit or satisfaction. Organizations have recently taken a notice on this problem and are willing to pay large amounts of money to maintain their information secured from people potentially wanting to harm them. The most common problems consist in the appearance of new types of criminals, the way these criminals are judicialized, the emergent roles in companies to protect their information, the way people are approaching such technologies, among others.

    Cyber-attacks are rising at the alarming pace. These criminals make use of different exploits such as Malware, Man in the middle, DDOS, SQL injections, Password attacks etc. to take advantage if certain system and acquire, modify, or even restrict the use of certain data a system has. In 2013 Adobe announced the information of 150 million accounts were stolen along with 40 GB of source code from certain application. This happened as a vulnerability was found where the publisher of the application had set up a password without sufficient methods of security to protect it which caused the hackers to find a direct way inside the administrator permissions of the platform. As many different methods of accessing a new technology have become easier companies not only have to invest in personnel to maintain their systems, but also ethical hackers which help them discover their vulnerabilities and pathways to enter their system.
<p>
    The ethical hacking is a term used to describe the role in a company which not only helps to search the vulnerabilities, but also helps to test the upcoming software of various companies to test their security, capabilities, and limits. These people are often former hackers who use their previous experience to avoid these types of attacks within companies and maintain a more secure software. In 2018, Eric Holmes was able to gain access to Homebrew’s source code in git which allowed him to make changes and exposing their supply chain. If malicious he could have installed an unnoticed change which would have allowed him to perform a backdoor within every machine who installed the software. However, Holmes decided to immediately report the vulnerability to a developer within the company which rapidly fixed and patched the bug. Unlike ethical hacking, common hackers don’t have any good intentions with the use of advantages they get which is also why most of them don’t get judicialized, or when they do, they can’t be processed correctly as the complexity of the crimes can’t be analyzed by the judge or jury correctly.
